Let us fix the following things I noticed in the code before proceeding to the next task.

1. You should put space after #include.
2. The signature of the main function is wrong. Lookup the correct `main()` signature preferrably in the recent standard for C language.
3. The name of the variable `flag` is misleading. Better name is `index` or similar. `flag` suggests a boolean value.
4. The size of `input` is off by one. This is the warning I see when I compile the program:
```
source.c:8:20: warning: 'scanf' may overflow; destination buffer in argument 2 has size 32, but the corresponding specifier may require size 33 [-Wfortify-source]
    8 |         scanf("%32[^\n]", input);
      |                           ^
```
5. `scanf()` is used quite rarely. Let us rewrite using `read()`. You have to run `read()` multiple times until in returns 0.
6. The source file should be named `main.c` or `t0.c`. Preferably, the source files should be in `src` subdirectory.
7. There should be a Makefile. Makefile should produce `t0` binary, not `a.out`.
8. There should be a `.gitignore` file which lists files, such as `*.o` and `t0`, so that binaries do not make it into repository. The repository is for texts only.
9. (Optional) You may remove the prompt (these are used rarely too). If the program is run as `t0 foo.bar` it would analyze its argument. If it is run as `t0` it would `read()` its standard input and analyze that.
